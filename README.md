# Reddit Communities

This project aims to detect communities on Reddit using graph traversal and search techniques. We utilize the "Reddit Hyperlink Network" dataset, which consists of a network of subreddits and their relationships based on shared links. The dataset includes information about subreddits, the number of subscribers, and interactions between subreddits in the form of shared links. For this project, we will only use the first 5,000 nodes.
